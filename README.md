# React Native 3D Experiment

This is a simple experiment to see how to use React Native to create a 3D scene. The experiment is based on the ThreeJS
and React Three Fiber libraries.

It also depends on the Expo library, especially the [Expo GLView](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/gl-view/).
